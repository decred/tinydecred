        constructor. The caller should provide callback functions for various
        events. The most common callbacks are listed here.

            on_open: Called at opening websocket. This function has one
                argument, the instance of Client.

            on_message: Called when data is received. on_message has 2
                arguments. The 1st argument is the instance of Client. The 2nd
                argument is the received message decoded (utf-8) as a str.

                argument is an Exception.

                one argument, the instance of Client.
