    Wallet is a wallet. An application would use a Wallet to create and
    manager addresses and funds and to interact with various blockchains.
    Ideally, blockchain interactions are always handled through interfaces
    passed as arguments, so Wallet has no concept of full node, SPV node, light
    wallet, etc., just data senders and sources.

    The Wallet is not typically created directly, but through its static methods
    `openFile` and `create`.

    The wallet has a mutex lock to sequence operations. The easiest way to use
    wallet is with the `with` statement, i.e.
        ```
        sender = lambda h: dcrdata.insight.api.tx.send.post({"rawtx": h})
        with wallet.open("dcr", ...) as w:
            w.sendToAddress(v, addr, sender)
        ```
    If the wallet is used in this way, the mutex will be locked and unlocked
    appropriately.
